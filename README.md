# Webapps

**Webapps are my vibecoding projects** — small, focused tools I build to make my life easier.

These projects usually start with a personal pain point: a repetitive task, a missing feature, or a workflow that should be simpler. Instead of tolerating it, I build a lightweight web app to solve it.

Most of these tools are:
- Practical over polished
- Purpose-built for speed and clarity
- Designed to reduce friction, clicks, or cognitive load
- Experiments in automation, data handling, or UX

Some may evolve into larger projects. Others exist simply because they solved a problem once—and that was enough.

If you find something here useful, feel free to adapt it. That’s the whole point.
